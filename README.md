## üìÅ Files

### Dockerfile üìÑ

The Dockerfile is the blueprint for building the Docker image for the tool. It starts from the latest Golang base image, sets the working directory to /app, and installs essential dependencies. It also clones the [Akash Network node repository](https://github.com/akash-network/node) and prepares the environment for the scripts to run.

### loop-payout.sh üí∏

This script is the heart of the tool. It runs in an infinite loop, querying the Akash Network for active leases and checking their remaining balance. If the balance is negative, it initiates a withdrawal transaction. The script also includes checks to ensure that necessary command-line tools are installed and available.

### start.sh üèÅ

This script sets up the environment for the tool to run. It sets several environment variables, including the Akash chain ID, node URL, keyring backend, and version. It also queries the Akash Network for the provider's address and prepares the environment for the loop-payout.sh script to run.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

To run the tool, use the following command:

### To run the tool, use the following command:

```
docker run -it \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/key.pem,target=/app/key.pem,readonly \
  --env PASS=replace_with_key_pem_pass \
  --env ONLY_NEGATIVE_BALANCES=false \
  --env PROVIDER=yourprovider.com \
  --env FEE=4000 \
  cryptoandcoffee/akash-provider-withdrawal
```
Replace replace_with_key_pem_pass with the password for your key.pem file and yourprovider.com with your provider's domain name.

*If you can't find your key.pem or password - you can get it from your running provider pod and save it locally!

```
kubectl cp akash-services/akash-provider-0:/boot-keys/key.txt ./key.pem
kubectl cp akash-services/akash-provider-0:/boot-keys/key-pass.txt ./key-pass.txt
```

## üåç Environment Variables

During runtime, you can set several environment variables to configure the behavior of the Akash Provider Withdrawal tool. These variables allow you to customize the tool's operation to suit your needs. Add them with --env to the docker run command in Usage section.
